# Rotate
*Rotate Minecraft Blocks and Change Paintings*

**Rotate** is a very simple plugin, which enables you to rotate blocks in Minecraft. Ever had that annoying moment when your stairs got placed in the wrong direction, or logs going crazy? Rotate aims to solve that by giving you a tool to rotate and fix those blocks. To make things even sweeter, Rotate has WorldGuard compatibility, so don't worry about griefers turning all your blocks around. Here's the full list of blocks that are supported:

+ **Stairs**
+ **Slabs**
+ **Logs**
+ **Pistons**
+ **Furnaces**
+ **Dispensers**
+ **Paintings**
+ **Pumpkins and Jack 'o Lanterns**
+ **Chests, Ender Chests and Double Chests**

Using Rotate couldn't be easier. Once you've downloaded the file and placed it in your plugins folder, simply reload your plugins (or restart your server) and then, while holding a tool (hoe, axe, pickaxe, stick or arrow) run the command. That will active Rotate on that tool. Then, it's just a matter of clicking on blocks to rotate them!

Note that by default permissions are disabled. If you want to use permissions, set it to true in the Rotate config file (generated when you first run the plugin). You can see what permissions are available below.

Please note that Rotate is in development, and though most features should work, there are and will be bugs. The code is open-source though, so feel free to check out the [Github](http://github.com/bongomice/rotate) page and fork the code, improve it and fix bugs.
